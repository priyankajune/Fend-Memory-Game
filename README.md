## Game-Instructions

1) This game is also known as Matching Game and the player has to match the 8 pairs of cards correctly in minimum time duration, to hold good star rating.
2) The timer starts as soon as the game begins and stops as the player completes the game.
3) The player can hit the restart button at any point of time to start the game all over again.
4) The cards get shuffled randomly as player hits restart or refreshes the page.

## Star-Rating
